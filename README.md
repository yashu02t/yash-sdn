# Defending Against Denial-of-Service Attacks in Software Defined Networks

## Problem Statement
Dos and DDos attacks are becoming more common as the cloud traffic is exponentially growing and more services are put on the cloud.
In this project, investigation was carried out to identify and mitigate Dos/DDoS attacks in the SDN (Software Defined Networks) environment. 
SDN offers a new centralized control plane paradigm approach, to control the network elements dynamically â€“ this can significantly improve efficiency and lower the cost to establish the network systems. 
Dos/DDos detection and mitigation applications were designed and written in Python to identify and also mitigate some of the important Dos/DDoS attacks.
